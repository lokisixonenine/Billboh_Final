# BillBoh -Historical Facts App

## User Story

We rely on our mobile phones more and more for just about everything. When traveling, we use it to get directions, translate foreign languages, and other tasks. Billboh helps enhance your travel adventures by providing facts and news based on your current location. This app is a play on J.R.R. Tolkien's famous character Bilbo Baggins and how he documented his adventures. Just like Bilbo Baggins, Billboh helps you make the most of your travels by providing information about the areas that you visit - all in the palm of your hand!
